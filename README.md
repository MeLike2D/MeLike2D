### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm 2D! I'm a 15-year-old full-stack developer from the United States. I usually work on discord bots but I make npm packages from time to time (mostly revolving around discord xD), but I do some UI/UX work... not very much though. 

### Stuff I know how to use.

> *ps: for things like vue and react I'm like partially good with them, I don't read through their APIs or use them enough lol.*

- Javascript / TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- Java and Kotlin
- Vue
- React
- Bulma CSS
- TailwindCSS
- Koa
- Express
- MongoDB
- RethinkDB
