# Hi there üëã

Hello! I'm Gino, a 16 y/o who's mostly a back-end developer. I say mostly back-end because I'm just not that experienced with front-end work.

## About Me

I'm from California üêª I mostly work on discord related things, such as bots and libraries - it's what I first did when learning how to code. I've worked on several things in the 3 years I've been a developer, such as NPM packages, Websites, APIs/Servers, and of course, Discord Bots. 

You can find me in my **Discord Server**: <https://discord.gg/JrHfSmb>, my tag is `2D#5773`
