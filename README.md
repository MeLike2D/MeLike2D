# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Gino, a 15 y/o full-stack developer from California. I mostly create discord bots or discord related things, kinda what started my development adventure :) I've also made several NPM packages and some UI/UX stuff which I plan on improving (like my personal website)

* **ðŸ”­** I am currently working on **Mandroc**, the guild bound bot for [@MenuDocs](https://github.com/menudocs).
* **ðŸŒ±** I am learning how to use Kotlin and all of its quirks, I've used it quite a lot in the past week :)

### Tools and Programming Languages

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Typescript, Coffeescript (lmao), Kotlin, Java, HTML, and CSS/SCSS
- **Tools**
  - **Frameworks**: Vue, React, [BulmaCSS](https://bulma.io), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), Express, and Koa.
  - **Databases**: MongoDB, [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com), and PostgreSQL (with [Prisma](https://prisma.io)).
