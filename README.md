# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Gino, a full-stack developer from California. I mostly create discord bots or discord related things, kinda what started my development adventure :) I've also made several NPM packages and some UI/UX stuff which I plan on improving (like my personal website)

<!-- * **ðŸ”­** I am currently working on **Mandroc**, the guild bound bot for [@MenuDocs](https://github.com/menudocs). -->
* **ðŸŒ±** I am learning how to use Kotlin and all of its quirks, I've used it quite a lot in the past week :)
* **ðŸ”­** I am currently developing [Obsidian](https://github.com/mixtape-bot/obsidian), a standalone audio sending node like [Lavalink](https://github.com/frederikam/lavalink), or [Andesite](https://github.com/natanbc/andesite)

##### Tools and Programming Languages

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Typescript, Coffeescript, Kotlin, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS/SCSS
- **Tools**
  - **Web Development**: Vue, React, [BulmaCSS](https://bulma.io), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - **Backend**: Express, Koa, and [Ktor](https://ktor.io)
