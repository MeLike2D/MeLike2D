# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm 2D! I'm a 15-year-old full-stack developer from the United States. I usually work on discord bots but I make npm packages from time to time (mostly revolving around discord xD), but I have done some UI/UX work... not very much though.

* **ðŸ”­** currently working on my new discord bot, [Kyu](https://github.com/kyudiscord), it will have a lot of cool features.   
* **ðŸŒ±** currently learning âœ¨ _nothing_ âœ¨ but... I do plan on learning [golang](https://golang.org/) or [rust](https://rust-lang.org/).

### Stuff I know how to use.

> *ps: for things like vue and react I'm like partially good with them, I don't read through their APIs or use them enough lol.*

- `Javascript` and `TypeScript`
- `HTML` and `CSS`
- `Java` and `Kotlin`
- `Vue` and `React`
- `Bulma CSS` and `TailwindCSS`
- `Koa` and `Express`
- `MongoDB`, `RethinkDB`, and `PostgreSQL` ([`prisma`](https://prisma.io))
