# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* **ðŸŒ±** I am learning how to use Kotlin and all of its quirks, I've used it quite a lot in the past week :)
* **ðŸ”­** I am currently developing [Obsidian](https://github.com/mixtape-bot/obsidian), a standalone audio sending node like [Lavalink](https://github.com/frederikam/lavalink), or [Andesite](https://github.com/natanbc/andesite)
